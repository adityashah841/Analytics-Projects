# Big Tech 15-Year Stock Analysis (2010‚Äì2025)

This repository contains all code and outputs for a comprehensive analysis of five leading technology stocks‚ÄîApple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA (NVDA)‚Äîover a 15-year period.  We cover:

1. **Data Preparation & EDA**  
2. **Trend & Volatility Analysis**  
3. **Principal Component Analysis**  
4. **Event Study (COVID-19 Crash)**  
5. **Forecasting** (ARIMA, Prophet, ETS, Ensembles)  
6. **Risk Assessment** (GARCH, VaR & ES)  
7. **Portfolio Simulations & Strategy Comparison**

- Generate simulation results & comparison charts

## üìë Scripts Overview
The provided R-markdown script follows the following outline
- Data Ingestion & Preparation
  - Load raw CSV of daily OHLCV data (2010‚Äì2025)
  - Compute daily log-returns for each ticker
  - Reshape into ‚Äúlong‚Äù and ‚Äúwide‚Äù formats for downstream tasks
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Plot closing‚Äêprice time series on linear and indexed (100 = Jan 2010) scales
  - Compute and plot 30-day rolling volatility of log-returns
  - Overlay all five stocks‚Äô daily log-returns on one chart
  - Show per-ticker return histograms to inspect tail behavior
- Correlation & Principal Component Analysis
  - Compute pairwise return correlations and display as heatmap
  - Run PCA on the daily return covariance matrix
  - Interpret PC1‚ÄìPC3 loadings and variance explained
  - Biplots (PC1 vs PC2, PC1 vs PC3) to visualize factor structure
- Event Study: COVID-19 Crash (Feb‚ÄìMar 2020)
  - Estimate market-model alphas and betas over 1-year pre-event window
  - Compute abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns (CAR)
  - Plot CARs for all tickers through the event window
  - Conduct t-tests and confidence-band inference on CAR
- Univariate Forecasting & Model Comparison
  - ARIMA on daily log-returns (20-day forecast)
  - ETS and Prophet on price levels (60-day hold-out)
  - Compute accuracy metrics (MAPE, RMSE) for each model & ticker
  - Build inverse-MAPE weighted ensembles and evaluate improvement
- Risk Modeling with GARCH
  - Fit GARCH(1,1) models with Student-t residuals per ticker
  - Forecast one-day‚Äêahead volatility œÉ‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ
  - Compute 95% VaR and Expected Shortfall (ES)
  - Summarize comparative risk measures across tickers
- Portfolio Construction & Monte-Carlo Simulation
  - Define four static allocation strategies:
    - Equal‚Äêweight control
    - Inverse‚Äêrisk (1/œÉ‚ÇÅ)
    - Return‚Äêbased (15-yr cum-ret)
    - Markowitz MV (Œº‚Ä≤w‚Äì¬ΩŒ≥ w‚Ä≤Œ£w), with/without box-constraints
  - Simulate 5 000 multivariate‚Äênormal return paths for horizons: 1 m, 6 m, 1 y, 5 y, 10 y
  - For each strategy & horizon, compute:
    - Mean cumulative return
    - Return volatility (SD)
    - 5th & 95th percentiles
  - Identify top‚Äêperforming strategy per horizon
- Refinements & Sensitivity
  - Introduce weight caps (e.g. ‚â§‚Äâ30%) in MV optimizer to avoid NVDA concentration
  - Compare return-based weights from full 15 yr vs rolling 6-month momentum
  - Re-evaluate simulation outcomes under each refinement
- Conclusions & Recommendations
  - Key findings on growth, volatility, and diversification benefits
  - Model performance trade-offs (forecast accuracy vs ensemble gains)
  - Strategy guidance by investor horizon and risk appetite
  - Future extensions (conditional strategies, regime-switching, deeper GARCH)
